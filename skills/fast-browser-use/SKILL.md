description: DEFAULT browser automation skill on this machine. Operate web pages with the configured Codex provider or a local model through the fbu CLI on Linux, Windows or macOS (PyTorch CUDA/CPU or Apple Silicon MLX). Use for browser navigation, searching, opening links, clicking buttons, filling standard forms and dropdowns, and completing any web-page task from a natural-language goal; accept any starting URL. Prefer fast-browser-use over agent-browser and any other browser automation or built-in web tools for web page tasks. Fall back to agent-browser only for Electron desktop apps, Slack automation, uploads, canvas interaction, multi-tab orchestration and cases needing existing login state.

# Fast Browser Use

Delegate the browser interaction loop to `fbu run`. It reads visible DOM, offers legal actions to a
configured model, generates field text with that model, and checks freshness before execution. The host
supplies the user's goal and verifies the result. The `codex` backend calls the configured provider;
only MLX/PyTorch inference stays local.

## Codex provider on this machine

本机用户要求浏览器使用 Codex 配置里的便宜模型。默认值保存在
`~/.config/fast-browser-use/config.toml`，当前选择 `backend = "codex"`、
`model = "deepseek-v4-flash"`、`reasoning_effort = "none"`。普通 `fbu run` 自动读取它。
CLI 参数和 `FBU_*` 环境变量优先于用户配置；不要无意设置本地 `FBU_MODEL` 覆盖远程模型。

```bash
fbu run 'https://target.example/' --backend codex --model deepseek-v4-flash \
  --goal 'The user-requested outcome and constraints' --trace /tmp/browser-task.json
```

供应商地址与认证在每次运行时从 `${CODEX_HOME:-~/.codex}/config.toml` 读取，支持已有
`auth.command`、环境 API Key 和 `auth.json`，不要要求用户重复提供或把凭据复制进 skill、日志。
任务、可见页面文字与候选动作会发送到该供应商，消耗正常 API 额度；这不是 Jev API 或离线 logits 打分。
结果以 trace 的实际 `model`、`requested_model`、`backend`、`usage` 和独立 `verification` 为准。
模型列表可见不能证明可调用；遇到供应商错误应说明证据，不自动升级成昂贵模型。
未暴露的 DOM 控件不会因为换模型自动出现；断言失败时检查 trace，再使用具备所需能力的浏览器工具完成验证。

本机可编辑运行时源码位于 `/Users/zjarlin/workspace/fast-browser-use`，`fbu` 通过
`uv tool install --editable` 安装。不要直接修改 site-packages；从源码修改并测试。

## Runtime setup

The skill contains instructions; the Python runtime, Chromium and weights are separate.
Check `fbu --help`. If missing, follow the source repository's README installation instructions;
do not assume a same-named PyPI package is this project. `uv tool install` exposes the CLI across
projects; `uv tool update-shell` and restarting the host may be needed for PATH discovery.

For local inference, prepare Chromium with `fbu install-browser` and explicitly download weights with
`fbu download --backend mlx` (Apple Silicon) or `fbu download --backend torch`. The supported model is
Qwen3.5-9B, pinned by default. Apple Silicon uses MLX 4-bit (~5.95 GB weights). Other platforms use the
`torch` extra and original Qwen3.5-9B weights; MLX and PyTorch weight formats are not interchangeable.
`FBU_BACKEND=auto` selects MLX on Apple Silicon and PyTorch elsewhere. `FBU_MODEL` can point to
matching local weights; remove stale overrides when switching backends. Other architectures/sizes are rejected.

For a Linux server, run `uv sync --locked --extra torch`, `uv run fbu install-browser --with-deps`,
and `uv run fbu download --backend torch`. Run tasks with `--backend torch --device cuda` (or `cpu`).
`cuda:N` selects a visible GPU. CUDA defaults to BF16 when supported, otherwise FP16; CPU uses FP32.
Allow roughly 18 GB for BF16/FP16 weights plus runtime memory, or 36 GB for FP32 weights alone.
No desktop, DISPLAY or Xvfb is needed. Windows uses the same CLI without `--with-deps`.

From a checkout, use `uv run --project /absolute/path/to/fast-browser-use fbu` in place of `fbu` after
`uv sync --locked`. Resolve model and trace paths against the user's working directory.

## Execute an arbitrary goal

```bash
FBU_BACKEND=mlx FBU_MODEL=/absolute/path/to/Qwen3.5-9B-4bit \
fbu run 'https://target.example/' \
  --goal 'The user-requested outcome and constraints' \
  --trace artifacts/task.json
```

The default uses the complete goal, one joint action/completion decision and bounded page settling
(`FBU_PLAN=0`, `FBU_REASONING=0`). `FBU_HEADLESS=0` displays the browser. No inspector UI is required.

Pass known end conditions when they can independently establish the requested outcome:

```bash
fbu run 'https://target.example/settings' \
  --goal 'Save workspace preferences with timezone Asia/Singapore and weekly digest enabled.' \
  --expect-title 'Preferences saved' \
  --expect-text 'Timezone: Asia/Singapore.' \
  --expect-text 'Weekly digest: enabled.' \
  --trace artifacts/preferences.json
```

`--expect-url` and `--expect-title` match exactly. Repeat `--expect-text` to require every fragment
in rendered body text. Assertions run on a fresh browser read after execution and are never fed
to the model as an action plan. They prove only the conditions supplied; a generic “Saved” message
alone does not prove field values. Without assertions, exit zero means the model reported DONE.

Read `status`, `verification`, `page`, `history`, `rejections` and `elapsed_ms` from the trace.
A DONE claim or action history alone does not prove success. If built-in assertions cannot establish
the outcome, independently inspect the resulting state before reporting completion.

## Record any task

```bash
FBU_MODEL=/absolute/path/to/Qwen3.5-9B-4bit \
fbu record --url 'https://target.example/' --goal 'The requested outcome' \
  --expect-url 'https://target.example/result' --output artifacts/recordings/task
```

Custom recordings require a URL, goal and at least one outcome assertion. `--scenario` options are
optional development demos, not a supported-sites list. Recordings always use headless Chromium, including when `FBU_HEADLESS=0` is set.
Raw recordings preserve all inference and waits. Preview rendering requires system ffmpeg/ffprobe. From the checkout, `scripts/render_demo.py RECORDING_DIR --name task --max-seconds 10`
creates a labeled accelerated preview, preserves the original video, and records actual task time
and playback speed separately. Only independently verified completed runs can be rendered.

## Execution boundaries

- Supply outcomes and user constraints; the configured model chooses steps and generates field values.
  Never replace the loop with host-generated selectors, executable model code, prepared field
  strings or site-specific action plans.
- Never automatically rerun a failed task that may have mutated the site. Reconcile the actual
  state before further authorized action. Fresh observations may reject stale decisions; dispatched
  mutations are recorded before post-action observation.
- Candidate softmax scores are relative preferences, not calibrated correctness probabilities.
- The browser uses a fresh isolated profile. Existing logins are not inherited. V1 lacks nested
  iframe/deep shadow traversal, canvas interaction, uploads and multi-tab orchestration.
- Traces contain page data and generated field values; keep personal traces and credentials out of git.

The runtime is site-independent; reliability is experimental. Qwen3.5-9B completed the measured
Wikipedia task at a 30.1 s median after optimization (three verified trials). The release examples
also cover simple navigation and a settings form; these do not establish general-web reliability.
Consult `docs/performance.md` in the repository for measurement boundaries and reproducible checks.
